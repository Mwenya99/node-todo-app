# Question

 Do a simple project using Node.js, ExpressJS and MySQL. It should provide endpoints to perform CRUD operations for a to-do app
Setup the project using npm
Install Express, MySQL or MySQL 2 (use this to connect to SQL database)
Download and install MySQL community and workbench for the Database
Establish a connection between the server and database in the project
Create 4 end points to create, read, update and delete a task
Endpoints should provide a response if the operation is a success or failure
Use the format {Status code, message} for the response
Status code should be a number and message should be object (for read operation) or string (especially for an error)
